# Is it possible beat Left Right Center?
Around the holidays my family enjoys a game of Left Right Center, a chance-based dice game where everyone puts a few dollars on the ine. It's a nice reprieve from the typical skill-based games much of family tends to play, and the only decision involved is what position within the family circle do you sit?

## The game
The game consists of each player starting with three one-dollar bills and attempting to be the last person with at least $1 left. The winner takes the full pot of dollar bills. It starts with the first player rolling three die with each face matching a resulting action:
- a roll of an "L" results in passing one dollar to the person to the left
- a roll of a "R" ...to the right
- a roll of a "C" results in placing one dollar in the middle of the table, removing it from the gameplay
- a roll of a "dot" results in the player keeping the dollar until the next turn

From there on the turn goes around the circle with each player tossing a number of die matching how many dollars they are holding (up to a maximum of three die). Dollars are accumulated and lost but no player is permanantly out of the game until a single dollar is remaining.

## So what?
