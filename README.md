# Left Right Center
Around the holidays my family enjoys a game of Left Right Center, a chance-based dice game. It's a nice reprieve from the typical skill-based games much of family tends to play, and the only decision involved is what position within the circle do you sit?

# The game
The game consists of each player starting with three one-dollar bills and attempting to be last person with at least $1 left. The winner takes the full pot of dollar bills. It starts with the first player rolling three die with each face matching an action:
- a roll of an "L" results in passing one dollar to the person to the left
- a roll of a "R" ...to the right
- a roll of a "C" results in placing one dollar in the middle of the table where no one receives the dollar and it is out of the game
- a roll of a "dot" results the player keeping the dollar

From there on the turn goes around the circle with each player tossing a number of die matching how many dollars they are holding up to a maximum of three die. Dollars are accumulated and lost but no player is permenantly out of the game until a single dollar is remaining and the holder collects their winnings.

# So what?
